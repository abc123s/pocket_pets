# Pocket Pets
A proof-of-concept AR game for iOS.

# How To Play
1. Choose a starter pocket pet
2. Travel around the real world with your phone
3. Encounter other pocket pets based on your physical location
4. Battle other pocket pets to level up your pocket pets
5. Use items to capture new pocket pets that you encounter

# Encountering pocket pets
The pocket pets you encounter are dependent on where you are physically located.

## Water pocket pets
Water pocket pets can be found whenever you are near or in water (e.g. by the Charles River: 42°22'07.8"N 71°07'03.9"W).

## Ground pocket pets
Ground pocket pets can be found whenever you are on solid land, far away from water (e.g. by the John Harvard statue: 42°22'28.0"N 71°07'02.6"W).

## Air pocket pets
Air pocket pets can be found whenever your phone's altitude reading is >10m higher than ground level at a particular location (e.g. 1000m above sea level at 42°22'28.0"N 71°07'02.6"W). Before you decide to throw your phone into the air, try going to the top of a tall building!

*Since the iPhone simulator does not simulate altitude, we artificially set the altitude in the screen cap above.*

# Battling pocket pets
After you encounter a pocket pet, you battle it with your pocket pet. During your turn, you can:
1. Use one of your pocket pet's attacks (they learn more as they gain experience and level up)
2. Use one of your items (e.g. a potion to heal your pocket pet)
3. Flee from the encounter

# Catching pocket pets
You can also catch the pocket pets that you encounter (easier to do when they are low health), and then use the pocket pets you catch in future pocket pet battles.
